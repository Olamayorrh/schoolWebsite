# CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE BUILDING YOUR REACT PROJECT:

# What is NPM

### npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, a vast online repository for JavaScript code and tools, allowing developers to easily install, share, and manage reusable code libraries (packages) and their dependencies for building applications. It includes a command-line tool (CLI) for interacting with the registry, managing project dependencies (like React or Express), running scripts, and handling versions, making it central to modern JavaScript development. npm is installed with Node.js, this means that you have to install Node.js to get npm installed on your computer.

# What is package.json?
### package.json is a special file that describes your Node.js project. It contains information about your app, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more.This file is essential for managing and sharing Node.js projects, especially when using npm (Node Package Manager).
### The package.json file is a manifest file in Node.js projects and npm packages, typically located in the root directory. It contains crucial metadata about the project and it is essential for managing dependencies, defining scripts, and providing information for publishing to the npm registry.The content of package.json must be written in JSON.At least two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.

### package.json provides a structured way to describe a project and its dependencies, while npm is the tool used to manage those dependencies and interact with the broader JavaScript package ecosystem.

# What is Vite? 
### Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that provides a blazing-fast development experience for modern web projects, significantly improving startup times and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) compared to older tools. It leverages native ES modules in the browser and uses tools like esbuild for dependency pre-bundling and Rollup for production builds, making development smoother for frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte. 
###  React refers to using Vite as the build tool and development server for a React application. It is a modern, fast, and lightweight front-end build tool that offers significant improvements in development experience compared to older bundlers like Webpack, especially for modern web projects.
